	<p>The art of losing isn't hard to master;
so many things seem filled with the intent
to be lost that their loss is no disaster.<br>

Lose something every day. Accept the fluster
of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.
The art of losing isn't hard to master.<br>

Then practice losing farther, losing faster:
places, and names, and where it was you meant 
to travel. None of these will bring disaster.<br>

I lost my mother's watch. And look! my last, or
next-to-last, of three loved houses went.
The art of losing isn't hard to master.<br>

I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,
some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.
I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster.<br>

â€”Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture
I love) I shan't have lied.  It's evident
the art of loosing's not too hard to master
though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.<br>
